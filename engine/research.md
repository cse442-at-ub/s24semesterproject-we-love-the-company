# Research

## PyGame

### Pros

* Simple
* Unit Testing is easy
* Version control is easy
* Tiny learning curve

### Cons

* Slow (which doesn't really matter)
* Python
* Limited
* No editor

## Godot

### Pros

* Efficient
* Can use languages better suited for scalable development (C++, C#, GDS)
* Has an editor

### Cons

* Git integration is builtin, but not specifically GitHub integration.
* Unit Testing requires additional plugins which may not work.
* Have to learn all the systems already present in the engine.

## Results

Although, Godot comes with a great deal of features, they are overkill and do not compensate for what Godot makes difficult.  
Since Unit Testing and Version Control are especially important Godot is not a great choice.  
The issues with PyGame can be easily worked around, as this is a relatively simple game.  
The ability to have Unit Testing and simple Version Control makes PyGame a better choice in this case.  
  
A sample PyGame app can be found in [pygame.py](pygame.py)
