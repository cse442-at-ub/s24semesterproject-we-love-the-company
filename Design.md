# Concept
The game is a singleplayer, top-down game that revolves around exploring a location and retrieving valuable items, which need to be brought back to a depository. There is an inherent risk/reward system built in, because the location can be explored as many times as the player wants before cashing out with their loot; but doing so is *always* risky, and could cause them to lose everything if they try. Very much inspired by [Lethal Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/).

# Items & Inventory
When picked up, an item is placed in the player's hands. Items can be stashed into an inventory, where they can be accessed in the inventory menu.
## Item Types
All items have some kind of value, but some have particular uses.
- **Loot** - Serves no functional purpose. Tends to be marginally more valuable than most other item types.
	- **Heavy Loot** - Much more valuable than standard loot, but slows you down a lot.
- **Weapon** - Allows you to defend yourself, but has a chance of breaking and becoming worthless when used too often.
	- **Lethal Weapon** - Instantly dispatches any enemy, but is very valuable if kept.
- **Consumable** - Can be destroyed to gain a bonus of some kind, like healing or a temporary buff.
## Inventory System
You can hold a limited number of items. If your inventory has too many items in it, you won't be able to stash items from your hands into your inventory. **Your hands are *not* an inventory slot,** and should not be treated as such; items in your hands are not in your inventory, and un-stashing an item to put it in your hands removes it from your inventory.
